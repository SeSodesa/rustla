/// A submodule whose transition functions for all patterns all make the document tree
/// focus on its parent and the parser pop from its state stack.

/// as in defined for each possible input, where it is needed.
/// 
/// Parsing definition lists is one of these cases, as other than
/// purely textual inputs need to be checked for first before interpreting
/// a definition term line as simple text.
