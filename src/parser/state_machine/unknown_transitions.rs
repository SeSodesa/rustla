/// A submodule whose transition functions for all patterns all make the document tree

/// This is useful in making the transitions from each state *complete*,

/// 
/// Parsing definition lists is one of these cases, as other than
/// purely textual inputs need to be checked for first before interpreting
/// a definition term line as simple text.
