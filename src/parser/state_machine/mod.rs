/// ### StateMachine
/// An enum of `MachineWithState`s.
/// Enclosing state variants in an enum allows us
/// to give ownership of a generic machine to an arbitrary structure,
/// as enums are only as large as their largest variant.
/// Inspired heavily by [this](https://hoverbear.org/blog/rust-state-machine-pattern/)
/// article.
/// 
/// The variants are used as keys to the static `TRANSITION_MAP`, which stores vectors of
/// transitions as values.

  /// Citation nodes may contain arbitrary body elements.

  /// of some kind. However, chained *internal* hyperlinks all reference the same target node,
  /// so a state of its own (this one) is reserved for parsing them until a node of a different kind (including other types
  /// of hyperlink targets) is encountered. Once this happens, all of the internal hyperlinks are set to point
  /// to this same target node. ???

  /// #### ExtensionOptions
  /// A state for parsing field lists inside diretives. Field lists located inside directive nodes
  /// work as directive parameters or settings.
  ExtensionOptions,

  /// #### Line
  /// A state for parsing section titles and document transitions (a.k.a. `\á¸©rulefill` commands in LaTeX terms).
  Line,

  /// #### Failure
  /// An explicit failure state. Allows explicit signalling of transition failures.
  Failure,

  /// #### EOF
  /// An End of File state. Could have also been named EOI, as in end of input,
  /// as this state is transitioned to when a parser reaches the end of its source input:
  /// This does not neecssarily correspond to the end of the given file during nested parsing sessions,
  /// as nested parsers are usually limited to a parsijng single block of text behind a node indentifier.
